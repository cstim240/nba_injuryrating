# Project Overview 

### A descriptive data analysis project to demonstrate the data analysis process starting from data acquisition, exploration, preparation, to analysis of findings, and visualization. 

### Business question: "Which NBA players are the most injury-prone based on historical data?"

### Audience: Fantasy Basketball Players, Casual fans, etc.

## Setup and Usage 

## Dataset and Data Collection Notes
- Since injury data will keep growing and changing over time, we have decided whether we should do a one-time snapshot of current data VS. an automated data scraping program for up-to-date injury reports. As of now, we are opting for the one-time snapshot. 
- Future ideas: 
  - Create a requirements.txt to list out installed libraries
  - Look into virtual environments
- Data source: Pro Sports Transaction (PST) which has the most recent injury data and its free!
- Method: We will create a Python script to fetch the webpage from PST, downloading all its table contents into a csv file. This script's initialversion can only download a page at a time. 
- Relevant libraries: 'requests',
